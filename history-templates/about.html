    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Since 2015 summer, East Asia Library (EAL) at University of Washington has collected a little more than 100 digital photographs from Korean Cuban immigrants in Cuba. Most of the photographs are black and white and are related to the earlier generations of Korean Cuban immigrants. Apart from the photographs that do not have the date information, the photographs show the time period from 1929 to 2012. This digital photographs collection shows Korean Cuban immigrants’ family lives and their gathering events.

    <p>
      Due to the lack of official diplomatic relations between South Korea and Cuba, it has been difficult to obtain research resources regarding Korean Cuban immigrants. EAL hopes that this digital photograph collection and webpage help people who have information needs regarding this topic.

    <h2>A Brief History of Korean Cuban immigrants</h2>
    <p>
      The history of Korean Cuban immigrations started with a dream for a better life from Incheon, Korea to Yucatán, Mexico in 1905. Over 1,000 Koreans sailed across Pacific Ocean to live a better life in Mexico. However, being tricked by the agency, they soon faced the harsh reality in Mexico, which was totally different than they had dreamed of. They had to work as henequen cutters and were exploited like slaves from early morning to late night <sup>1</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After 16 years, around 300 Korean left for Cuba hoping a better life with sugar cane farming and arrived on May 25, 1921. Unfortunately, due to the unstable Cuban economy, most of them had to do henequen farming again in Cuba. Despite the difficult circumstances, they settled down in a small village near Matanzas called El Boro, where the <i>Memorial Coreano</i> stands until now <sup>2</sup>. Now, there are around 1,100 Korean Cuban in Cuba, and the community center for Korean Cuban descendants opened in 2014 to keep on their Korean identity for generations <sup>3</sup>.

    <h2>A Korean Independence Activist in Cuba, Cheon-Taek Lim and his descendants</h2>
    <p>
      During the time when Korea had been taken over by Japanese imperial rule, one of the first generation of Korean Cuban immigrants, Cheon-taek Lim (Ernesto Lim, 임천택, 林千澤, 1903~1985), had put forth great efforts to support Korean independence movement. Despite the hardships, he financially supported the movement and educated the next generation of Korean Cuban immigrants by building Korean schools in Cuba. In 2004, seven years after he passed away, he was buried at the National Cemetery in Korea in recognition of his contributions <sup>4</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing Lim’s legacy, his descendants have been trying to keep Korea’s identity and roots in Korean Cuban immigrants’ society. His son Jeronimo Im Kim, who passed away in 2006, led the Korean Cuban community for several years and put effort to keep Korea’s identity in the community <sup>5</sup>. His daughter Martha Lim Kim wrote a book about Korean Cuban immigrants in Spanish, <i>Coreanos en Cuba</i> <sup>6</sup>, and donated the photographs so that people can share the history. His great-granddaughter Azaria Lim is now studying at Hannam University in Korea, majoring Global Communication Culture, to learn more about Korea and her roots <sup>7</sup>.
